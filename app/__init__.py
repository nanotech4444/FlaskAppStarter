"""
In a Python project, an __init__.py file within a directory signals to Python that the directory should be considered a
Python package. This means that the directory can be imported as a module, and other Python files within the directory
can be organized as submodules.

The presence of an __init__.py file allows you to create a hierarchical structure of modules, making code organization
cleaner and more maintainable.

Here's a brief overview of what the __init__.py file can do:

Package Initialization: You can place initialization code for your package inside the __init__.py file, and it will be
executed when the package is imported.

Define __all__ for Wildcard Imports: By defining a list called __all__ in your __init__.py file, you can control what
is imported when a user performs a wildcard import (from package import *).

Submodule Import Control: You can write import statements in __init__.py to make submodules available at the package
level, allowing users to access them with shorter import paths.

Empty __init__.py: Even an empty __init__.py file serves the purpose of marking a directory as a package, though it
doesn't provide any of the additional functionality mentioned above.
